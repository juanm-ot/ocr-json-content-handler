## Introduction
### Context
This project focuses on extracting key information from property certificates using JSON files generated by an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) process. 

OCR is a technology that converts printed text into digital data. AWS Textract, an Amazon service, performs OCR on PDF documents via its DetectDocumentText API. This API processes the PDFs and produces JSON files containing the extracted text and its coordinates in the document. The project uses these JSON files as input to extract specific information from the property certificates

### Project Goal 
The goal is to develop a Python script that extracts specific fields from JSON files produced by AWS Textract for property certificates. The JSON files contain OCR results from the first page of each certificate. The script should:

1. Accept the path to the JSON file as input
2. Extract he property registration number (Nro Matrícula), printing date (in YYYY-MM-DD format), department, municipality, locality (vereda), and folio status from the JSON data.
3. **Generalize**:Ensure the script can process any certificate with a similar structure and field arrangement.
